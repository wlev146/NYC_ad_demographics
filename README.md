Overview

This project looks at how NYC moves and how NYC complains. I worked with MTA turnstile data to understand the flow of people through the city, and 311 complaint data to understand what problems and frustrations show up in different neighborhoods. The goal was not just to analyze numbers but to read the city almost like a story and show what these patterns say about everyday life.

The main idea behind the project is that raw data can reveal emotion, behavior, and culture if you read it the right way.

Project Focus

Turnstile data shows movement, routine, congestion, and how different areas “breathe.”
311 complaints show stress points, annoyances, and what people care enough to report.
The Humor Opportunity Score is a creative tool I built to find moments where these two worlds collide. These are the moments where a neighborhood’s flow and its complaints create some kind of irony, contrast, or unintentional comedy. It is more of a cultural lens than a strict model.


Even though this is a data project, the heart of it is interpretation.
I treated the city like a text filled with patterns and contradictions.
The visuals and analysis work like storytelling, not just statistics.
This project fits the class because it asks what these patterns say about people, space, and the culture of a huge city. It is about meaning more than measurement.

Methods

I cleaned and organized large turnstile and 311 datasets.
I grouped and joined them to compare movement and complaints across time and boroughs.
I built visualizations to show where the biggest spikes and mismatches happened.
The Humor Opportunity Score was created using complaint volume, flow intensity, timing, and places where expectations and reality didn’t match. It highlights where city life becomes unintentionally funny.

Insights

Neighborhoods with heavy movement but weirdly low or oddly high complaints created the best humor opportunities.
Some areas showed how stress moves with people, while others showed how noise, crowding, and timing create tension.
Putting the two datasets together made it clear how the city’s mood shifts hour by hour and block by block.

Reflection

This project helped me approach data as something expressive, not just technical.
It taught me to think about how numbers reflect the lived experience of a place.
For my digital portfolio, this shows how I can combine analysis with storytelling and cultural interpretation.
